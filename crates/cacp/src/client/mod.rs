//! Drive an ACP agent from a client.
//!
//! Implement [`Client`] and hand it to [`spawn`] or one of the `connect_*`
//! functions. You get back an [`AgentConn`] for calling the agent — opening
//! sessions, sending prompts, cancelling turns.
//!
//! Every optional method of [`Client`] defaults to replying "method not found",
//! so an agent asking for something you do not serve gets a clean refusal and
//! carries on.
//!
//! A frontend with an event loop of its own can take `cacp-events` instead,
//! which serves this trait over a channel.
