//! A channel-based [`Client`](cacp::Client) for [`cacp`].
//!
//! A frontend already has an event loop. [`channel`] hands it one instead of a
//! trait to implement: a [`Client`](cacp::Client) to give [`spawn`](cacp::spawn),
//! and the [`Events`] stream every call from the agent arrives on.
//!
//! Anything you do not match on is declined with `method not found`, exactly as
//! an unimplemented [`Client`](cacp::Client) method would be — so a consumer
//! that ignores an [`Event`] is indistinguishable on the wire from one that
//! never served that method. Declare what you do serve in
//! [`ClientCapabilities`](proto::ClientCapabilities), as ever.
//!
//! Notifications arrive in wire order. A request is dispatched on its own task,
//! so it can reach the stream just after a notification that followed it on the
//! wire.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cacp_events::Event;
//!
//! # async fn run() -> cacp::Result<()> {
//! let (client, mut events) = cacp_events::channel();
//! let (_agent, _child) = cacp::spawn(&mut tokio::process::Command::new("my-agent"), client)?;
//!
//! while let Some(event) = events.recv().await {
//!     match event {
//!         Event::Update(notification) => println!("{:?}", notification.update),
//!         Event::Permission(request, reply) => reply.send(
//!             cacp::schema::RequestPermissionResponse::selected(
//!                 request.options[0].option_id.clone(),
//!             ),
//!         ),
//!         _ => {}
//!     }
//! }
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
